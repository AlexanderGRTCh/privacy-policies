<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>App:</strong> Habit Tracker 2026</p>
<p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 18, 2026</p>

<p>
Habit Tracker 2026 ("the App") helps you track personal goals with daily check-ins,
streaks, and reminders. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used,
and your choices regarding that data.
</p>

<h2>No Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>
All goal and habit data is stored locally on your device only.
The App does not require account creation and does not transmit your personal goal data to any server.
</p>

<h2>Data You Provide</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Goal information you enter (such as goal titles, descriptions, dates, and custom reminder text).</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is stored locally on your device and is never sent to us or any third party.</p>

<h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Goals, check-ins, missed days, notes, and settings are stored locally using on-device storage (Hive and SharedPreferences).</li>
  <li>A cached premium subscription status (true/false) is stored locally via SharedPreferences so the App can load quickly before the network is available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App integrates the following third-party services, which may automatically collect certain data as part of their operation:</p>

<h3>Google AdMob (advertising)</h3>
<p>AdMob may collect the following categories of data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Device or other IDs</strong> — Android advertising ID, device identifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> — IP address is used to determine country or region-level location for ad targeting.</li>
  <li><strong>App activity and interactions</strong> — Ad views, ad taps, and in-app interaction data used to measure ad performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> — Crash logs and performance data related to ad rendering.</li>
</ul>
<p>AdMob data collection applies only to free-tier users. Premium subscribers do not see ads, so AdMob does not collect data for premium users.</p>
<p>For more information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google uses information from apps that use AdMob</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Google Play Billing (subscription processing)</h3>
<p>Google Play processes all subscription transactions. Google may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purchase history</strong> — Subscription plan purchased, transaction dates, and payment status.</li>
  <li><strong>Device or other IDs</strong> — Used to associate purchases with your Google account.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

<h3>RevenueCat (subscription management and receipt validation)</h3>
<p>RevenueCat manages subscription status and validates purchase receipts. RevenueCat may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purchase history</strong> — Subscription product identifiers, purchase dates, expiration dates, trial status, and renewal events.</li>
  <li><strong>Device or other IDs</strong> — An anonymous app user ID and device identifiers used to associate subscription status with your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or Google account information from the App.</p>

<h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Core functionality:</strong> To provide goal tracking, reminders, check-ins, streaks, and progress tracking — all processed locally on your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To display personalized ads (free-tier users only) and measure ad performance via Google AdMob.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> To process purchases, validate receipts, restore subscriptions, and manage premium entitlement status via Google Play Billing and RevenueCat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The App does not sell your personal data to any third party.</li>
  <li>Data is shared with third-party providers (Google and RevenueCat) only as required to provide advertising and subscription services, as described above.</li>
  <li>No goal data, habit data, or notes you enter are ever shared with any third party.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Goal data, check-ins, notes, and settings remain on your device until you delete them within the App or uninstall the App. Uninstalling removes all locally stored data.</li>
  <li><strong>Third-party data:</strong> Data collected by Google AdMob, Google Play Billing, and RevenueCat is retained according to their respective privacy policies and retention schedules. The App does not control the retention of data held by these third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All user-created data (goals, check-ins, notes, settings) is stored on-device using Android's application sandboxing, which restricts access to the App's private storage.</li>
  <li>The App does not store passwords, payment information, or sensitive personal identifiers.</li>
  <li>Subscription transactions are processed securely by Google Play and validated by RevenueCat over encrypted (HTTPS) connections.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> You can delete individual goals within the App, or uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data from your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove ads:</strong> You can purchase a Premium subscription to stop all ad-related data collection by AdMob.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage subscriptions:</strong> You can manage, cancel, or change your subscription through Google Play Settings or through the "Manage Subscription" option in the App's Settings screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising preferences:</strong> You can reset or opt out of personalized ads through your Android device settings (Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads).</li>
  <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have direct access to it at all times through the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information
from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has
provided personal information through the App, please contact us at the email below so we can
take appropriate action.
</p>

<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
The App stores all user data locally on your device. However, third-party services (Google and RevenueCat)
may process data on servers located outside your country of residence, including in the United States.
These transfers are governed by the privacy policies of the respective third-party services.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes
acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
