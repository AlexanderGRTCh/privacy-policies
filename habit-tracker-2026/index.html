## App: Habit Tracker 2026

Habit Tracker 2026 ("the App") helps you track personal goals with daily check-ins, streaks, and reminders.

## No Cloud Storage

All goal and habit data is stored locally on your device only. The App does not require account creation and does not transmit personal data to our servers.

## Data You Provide

- Goal information you enter (e.g., goal title/description, dates, custom reminder text).

This data is stored locally on your device.

## Data Stored on Your Device

- Goals, check-ins, missed days, and settings are stored locally using on-device storage (Hive / SharedPreferences).
